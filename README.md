# Everforest ported for doom emacs
Everforest is a green based color scheme; it's designed to be warm and soft in order to protect developers' eyes.

Ported from https://github.com/sainnhe/everforest
The theme file is based on doom-miramare-theme.el from the doom-themes repository https://github.com/doomemacs/themes
